## 🧾 About Me

I recently completed my MCA and have been applying my skills through hands-on development work.  
Most of my experience comes from academic projects and self-driven learning. I’m currently revisiting past projects and expanding them with new features and technologies.

## 🧩 Projects

### 🔍 Investigate AR *(Academic Project)*  
An AR-based detective game built using Unity and Firebase.  
Players interact with virtual clues placed in real-world environments using mobile AR.

> 📌 **Note:** This was submitted as my MCA final project. I’m now reworking it from scratch with plans to add new features, including ML-based clue detection using YOLOv8.
