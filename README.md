## 🧾 About Me

I’m an MCA graduate with hands-on experience in Python programming, front-end web development, and Unity C# scripting. My learning journey has been shaped by academic projects and self-directed exploration of real-world technologies.

> 🧠 While I haven't used the full Unity Editor or deployed Firebase-based projects yet, I have studied their workflows and written C# scripts to simulate gameplay logic in AR environments. I'm currently focused on improving my backend skills and exploring AI integrations using Python.

## 🧩 Projects

### 🔍 Investigate AR *(Academic Project – Scripting Prototype)*  
A detective game prototype based on Augmented Reality concepts, created using Unity C# scripting logic.

- Developed sample game logic scripts (`ARGameController.cs`) for scene transitions, player-clue interaction, and trigger-based gameplay flow.  
- Designed a storyline progression with scenario-based player choices and immersive UI/UX flow (conceptualized based on Unity documentation/tutorials).  
- Explored how Firebase could be used for player authentication and game data (not implemented).  
- Currently planning to integrate Python and **YOLOv8** for AI-based clue detection and gameplay analytics.

> 📌 Submitted as part of my MCA final project. This project reflects my interest in combining immersive tech with AI, and my commitment to learning by doing.
