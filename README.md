## 🧾 About Me

I recently completed my MCA and have been applying my skills through hands-on development work.  
Most of my experience comes from academic projects and self-driven learning.  
I’m currently revisiting past projects and expanding them with new features and technologies.

> 🧠 I used **C# primarily for Unity scripting** — handling basic scene control, object placement, and triggers. I'm currently learning **core C# programming concepts** outside Unity to grow into full-stack development.

Players interact with virtual clues placed in real-world environments using mobile AR.

> 📌 This was submitted as my MCA final project. Currently reworking the project from the ground up, with plans to add new features — including machine learning-based clue detection using YOLOv8.
