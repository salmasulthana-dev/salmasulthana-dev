## 🧾 About Me

I recently completed my MCA and have been actively applying my skills through hands-on project work.  
Most of my experience is rooted in academic projects and self-driven learning, where I explored real-world applications of technology.

> 🧠 I’ve used **C# primarily for Unity scripting** — working on basic scene control, object interactions, and event triggers. I'm now diving deeper into **core C# concepts** to grow toward full-stack development.

I enjoy learning by building, and I’m currently expanding and refining my older projects with new features and technologies.

### 🔍 Investigate AR *(Academic Project)*  
An AR-based detective game built using Unity and Firebase.  
Players explore real-world environments to uncover virtual clues using their mobile device.

> 📌 Submitted as my MCA final-year project. I'm now redesigning it from scratch and plan to integrate **YOLOv8** for machine learning-based clue detection.
